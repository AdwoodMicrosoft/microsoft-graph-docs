# Payment requirements for the OneDrive and SharePoint APIs

This article describes the licensing and payment requirements for the SharePoint and OneDrive APIs in Microsoft Graph.

The following APIs have consumption charges:

- [AssignSensitivityLabel API](http://https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-assignsensitivitylabel?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http "AssignSensitivityLabel API") [Private Preview] – Asynchronously assigns a sensitivity label to a file hosted in OneDrive or SharePoint online. 

 Note: You must [associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory// "associate") or [create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscriptionp:// "create") Azure Subscription for your tenant to call the AssignSensitivityLabel API.  During Private Preview, an Azure billing statement will be created you to see the details of the transactions, however, no charge will be associated with that bill. Please see“Enroll in the Preview" below for instructions on how to apply to be in the Assign Sensitivity Label Private Preview. 

## Licensing model at General Availability 

The AssignSensitivityLabel API, will follow a per call billing model at General Availability.

For your application to enroll in the Preview to call [AssignSensitivityLabel](hhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-assignsensitivitylabel?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=httpttp:// "AssignSensitivityLabel"), we require you to complete this request form providing an active Azure subscription. Once we have processed your request form, we will follow up with next steps to onboard your application to billing.
