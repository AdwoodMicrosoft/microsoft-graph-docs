## Response

If successful, the API returns response code `202 Accepted` with empty response body, the `Location` header will provide url to fetch operation details.
For more details about how to monitor progress of assign sensitivity label operation, please refer to [monitoring long running operations](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

In addition to general errors that apply to Microsoft Graph, this API returns the `423 Locked` response code, which indicates that the file being accessed is locked. In such cases, the **code** property of the response object indicates the error type that blocks the operation.
The following are the possible values for the error types.

| Value                       | Description                                                                                                         |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fileDoubleKeyEncrypted      | Indicates that the file is protected via double key encryption; hence it cannot be opened.                          |
| fileDecryptionNotSupported  | Indicates that the encrypted file has specific properties which do not allow these files to be opened by SharePoint.|
| fileDecryptionDeferred      | Indicates that the file is being processed for decryption; hence it cannot be opened.                               |
| unknownFutureValue          | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Do not use.                                                                   |

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of a request.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "assignSensitivityLabel", "tags": "service.graph" } -->
``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/root/items/016GVDAP3RCQS5VBQHORFIVU2ZMOSBL25U/assignSensitivityLabel
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sensitivityLabelId": "5feba255-812e-446a-ac59-a7044ef827b5",
  "assignmentMethod": "standard",
  "justificationText": "test_justification"
}
```


### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/QXNzaWduU2Vuc2l0aXZpdHlMYWJlbCxiMzc3ODY3OS04OWQ3LTRkYmYtYjg0MC1jYWM1NzRhY2FlNmE?tempAuth=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhb....
```
The value of the `Location` header provides a URL for a service that will return the current state of the assign sensitivity label operation.
You can use this information to [determine when the assign sensitivity label operation has finished](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

### Remarks
The response from the API will only indicate that the assign sensitivity label operation was accepted or rejected; for example, due to file type not being supported or file is double encrypted.
